Consider two scenarios here
	1) If the index of upcoming element is greater than top of the stack, add it to the stack and proceed with recursion
	2) If index is less than the top of stack, proceed with recursion for two scenarios
		a. Pop the top of the stack until the top of the stack has a lesser index, add the index to the stack and proceed with recursion
		b. Ignore the smaller index and proceed with recursion for subsequent indexes 
Return the max value out of all scenarios.
