Given the No.of Test cases T,
the next T lines will consider the following inputs,
N,M where N and M are sizes of the input arrays.
Next line will consider N space separated distinct integers (Array A)
and next line will contain M space separated not necessarily distinct integers(Array B).

Solution is to find the minimum number of elements needed to be added in the array B so that it can contain a subsequence in the same order of array A.
